# Data Science and AI
This is my repository for the course Introduction to Data Science and AI at at Chalmers University of Technology.

## Projects:

### Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Anlysis
Conducting an exploratory analysis on how life expectancy relates to GDP-per-capita ([link](https://github.com/calvinnsmith/Data-Science-and-AI/tree/main/DIT406/Ass%201)).
### Assignment 2: Regression and Classification
Basic exploration of linear regression and classification (kNN) ([link](https://github.com/calvinnsmith/Data-Science-and-AI/tree/main/DIT406/Ass%202)).
### Assignment 3: Clustering
Exploring K-means clustering and DBSCAN ([link](https://github.com/calvinnsmith/Data-Science-and-AI/tree/main/DIT406/Ass%203)).
### Assignment 4: Classifying e-mails.
In this project we built different naive Bayes classifiers for the task of classifying e-mails as either spam or "ham" (i.e not spam) ([link](https://github.com/calvinnsmith/Data-Science-and-AI/tree/main/DIT406/Ass%204)).
### Assignment 5: Building CNN's
In this project we explored building and training convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow and the MNIST digits dataset [link](https://github.com/calvinnsmith/Data-Science-and-AI/tree/main/DIT406/Ass%207)).
